## Overview

### The challenge
* We decided to create something that will be both useful and funny
* Something that we all need? Food!
* Something that we never have enough? Laugh!
* When the two powers combine, they summon Earth's greatest champion, FoofFinder!

### While using fruits of our work
* You can search food recipes found on [www.edamam.com](https://www.edamam.com/)
* There may or may not be some [surprises](https://tenor.com/) waiting for you
